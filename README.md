# ApkMuzzle

[ApkMuzzle](https://github.com/simoneaonzo/ApkMuzzle/blob/master/app/app-release.apk?raw=true) is an Android application for remove unwanted permissions from Android APKs without ROOT  permission!

How it works? It uses [RmPerm](https://github.com/simoneaonzo/RmPerm) (follow the link for a more detailed description) as external library and use the custom methods defined [here](https://github.com/simoneaonzo/ApkWithCustomMethods).

## Available on Google Play Store

You can clone this repo and build it...  or you can comfortably download the app [from the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.unige.dibris.andrmperm).

## How can I use it?

I spent some hours for screenshots, description and video... see them on the Google Play Store.

## The GUI is horrible man!?!

I know. But I hate developing graphical interfaces. But this is project is free software, you can contribute with your beautiful colors!
